    "In this project to decide what our metric would be, we had to think about what feature(s) of a neighborhood are most important to us. We thought about a few different metrics ranging from entertainment to livability. Eventually we landed on Public Safety since you canâ€™t go wrong being in a safe neighborhood without having to worry about yourself being out and about. We used 3 data sets total to figure out which neighborhood was the best based on public safety.\n",

    "## The Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "As said before, our chosen metric is Public Safety. We narrowed down to what we thought public safety was into 3 different categories. The first was a no-brainer crime, so we selected an arrest report data set to analyze. We used the total number of arrests and arrest rate of minors for each neighborhood to evaluate this metric. The second category we thought of was healthcare/Emergency services around. For this we selected an EMS facilities dataset that contained all the EMS in the neighborhoods around Pittsburgh. We used the number and size of EMS facilities for this sub-metric. The final category chosen was fire incidents around the Pittsburgh area. For this we used a Fire Incident Reports dataset to find the number and severity of fire incidents across neighborhoods. To decide which neighborhood would be ranked as the most safe, each of us did a point ranking system for each dataset based on certain qualities. For example, for the EMS facilities 10 points were given for each EMS facility in a neighborhood and an incremented score was given for the size of each of those facilities. \n",
